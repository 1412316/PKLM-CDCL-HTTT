Game designers are really good
Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements
Games are sometimes played purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well
Games can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals
On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play
Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player
Business games can take a variety of forms, from interactive board games to interactive games involving different props and different kinds of activities
The purpose of these games is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to generate discussions about business improvement
Online games have been part of culture from the very earliest days of networked and time-shared computers
Early commercial systems such as Plato were at least as widely famous for their games as for their strictly educational value

Some video games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice, while others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical in design, each with its own set of rules or goals
