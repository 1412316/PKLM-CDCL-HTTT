A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool
I like playing God of War
Japanese games are getting more popular in the world
children like violent games and it can make them become more violent in the future
Game designers are really good
Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements
Games are sometimes played purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well
Games can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals
On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play
Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player
